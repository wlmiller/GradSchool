{"name":"Grad School Code","tagline":"Some example code from my graduate school studies.","body":"Grad School Code\r\n===\r\n\r\nThis repository contains example code from my time working toward my Ph.D. from Columbia University in Chemical Physics.\r\n\r\n## [Janus_MD.c](Janus_MD.c)\r\n\r\nThis code runs a simulation of a generalization of so-called \"Janus\" particles.  Janus particles are particles which are one-half attractive and one-half repulsive; our generalization allows that ratio to vary from one-half.  For more information, see [1].\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n```\r\n./Janus_MD thetaMax e0 range\r\n```\r\nWhere:\r\n\r\n* `thetaMax` = The maximum angle of the attractive region (Janus particles are recovered for `thetaMax = pi`.\r\n* `e0` = The dept of the attractive well (in unitless energy).\r\n* `range` = The range of the attractive part of the interaction potential as compared to the repulsive part; `range = 1` is a standard Lennard-Jones potential.\r\n\r\n## [aspherical_coexistence.c](aspherical_coexistence.c)\r\n\r\nPerforms a Monte Carlo of a box containing one-half fcc crystalline and one-half liquid-phase hard aspherical particles. Particles are constructed as described in [2], by placing some number of balls in an overlapping configuration.  The number of balls and degree of overlap are adjustable, allowing for control of the degree of asphericity.  See [3] for more information.\r\n\r\n### Usage:\r\n```\r\n./aspherical_coexistence nBall sigma pressure\r\n```\r\nWhere:\r\n\r\n* `nBall` = the number of balls of which the particles are constructed\r\n* `sigma` = how far from the particle center balls are placed in particle construction\r\n* `pressure` = the system pressure\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n1.
